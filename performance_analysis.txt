=== AI Coach Feedback ===
**1. Critical Issues:**

1. **Inconsistent Accuracy Across Keys:**  Significant discrepancies in accuracy between keys (Q, W, E, R) indicate a lack of consistent finger placement, hand coordination, and muscle memory.  The low accuracy on W is particularly alarming.
2. **High Number of Missed Notes (152):** This suggests problems with timing and rhythm, potentially stemming from inaccurate note reading speed or poor strumming consistency.
3. **High Number of Wrong Keys (261):**  This directly reinforces the inconsistency issue, pointing towards difficulties with hand-eye coordination and quick, accurate fretting.


**2. Practice Exercises:**

* **Issue 1 (Inconsistent Accuracy):**
	* **Key-Specific Drills:** Focus on individual keys with progressively faster sequences of notes (start slow, gradually increase speed).  Use Guitar Hero's practice mode to isolate specific sections with problematic keys.
	* **Hand Coordination Exercises:** Practice scales and chords using only the problematic keys.  Focus on smooth transitions and precise finger placement.

* **Issue 2 (Missed Notes):**
	* **Metronome Practice:** Play along with a metronome at a comfortable speed, gradually increasing tempo as accuracy improves. Focus on maintaining consistent strumming rhythm.
	* **Rhythm Games:**  Supplement with rhythm-based games or apps to improve timing and precision.

* **Issue 3 (Wrong Keys):**
	* **Visual Focus Exercises:**  Concentrate intensely on the note highway, slowing down initially if needed to improve visual tracking.
	* **Reduced Note Density:** Practice songs with fewer notes initially to build confidence and accuracy.  Gradually increase difficulty.


**3. Recommended Training Plan (Next Session):**

1. **Warm-up (15 min):** Simple scales and chords using all four keys, focusing on consistent strumming.
2. **Focused Practice (30 min):**  Address the weakest key (W) using key-specific drills and metronome practice.  Incorporate visual focus exercises.
3. **Song Practice (30 min):** Play songs at a comfortable difficulty, focusing on consistent accuracy and rhythm.  Use practice mode to address specific sections.
4. **Cool-down (15 min):** Easy songs to maintain a positive learning experience.


**4. Encouragement:**

Your overall accuracy of 105.2% is impressive and shows your potential! While there’s room for improvement, you've demonstrated excellent reflexes with your extra presses being 0.  Focus on improving consistency across keys through targeted practice, and you'll see significant progress.  Remember to prioritize accuracy over speed in the initial stages of practice.
