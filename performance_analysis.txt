=== AI Coach Feedback ===
**1. Critical Issues:**

* **Inconsistent Accuracy Across Keys:**  Significant discrepancies exist between Q/E key accuracy (under 70%) and W/R key accuracy (over 87%). This indicates a lack of consistent finger placement and timing on the smaller red and yellow buttons.
* **High Number of Wrong Keys:**  232 wrong keys are excessive, even with high hit counts. This points to rushed playing and insufficient focus on precise button selection.
* **Missed Notes (though low):** While low, the missed notes highlight occasional lapses in concentration and rhythm maintenance, especially noticeable on the Q and E keys.


**2. Practice Exercises:**

* **Key-Specific Drills:** Focus on isolated sections using only Q and E keys at slower speeds, gradually increasing tempo.  Repeat with W and R.  Use GH practice mode to loop difficult sections.
* **Accuracy Focus:** Utilize "Slow Mode" (if available in the game) and prioritize perfect accuracy over speed.  Focus on smooth transitions between keys.
* **Rhythm Training:** Use a metronome alongside simpler songs.  Gradually increase tempo while maintaining accuracy. Incorporate exercises focusing on consistent strumming patterns.


**3. Recommended Training Plan (Next Session):**

1. **Warm-up (15 mins):** Simple songs at slow speeds focusing on rhythm and consistent strumming.
2. **Key-Specific Drills (30 mins):**  Prioritize Q and E keys, focusing on accuracy. Then repeat for W and R.
3. **Accuracy Focused Gameplay (30 mins):**  Play songs at comfortable speeds, focusing solely on perfect accuracy.  Avoid speed-running.
4. **Cool-down (15 mins):** Play a favourite song at normal speed to reinforce learned skills.


**4. Encouragement:**

Your hit count is impressive, demonstrating good overall rhythm and stamina!  The high percentage of correct hits shows you're capable of precise playing. By addressing the inconsistencies in key accuracy and wrong notes, you'll significantly elevate your score and enjoyment of the game.  Focus on precision and consistency, and you'll see rapid improvement.
