**1. Critical Issues:**

* **Inconsistent Accuracy Across Keys:**  Significant disparity in accuracy between keys (e.g., R key's 92.3% vs. Q key's -29.4% and E key's 14.3%) indicates a lack of consistent finger placement and timing across the fretboard.  The negative accuracy on the Q key suggests a more serious problem than simple inaccuracy.
* **Significant Q Key Issues:** The -29.4% accuracy and high number of wrong notes on the Q key strongly suggest a fundamental problem with either finger placement, hand position, or muscle memory for that key. This needs immediate attention.
* **Missed Notes (though fewer):** While fewer than wrong notes, missed notes still indicate timing issues that need to be addressed for improved overall score.


**2. Practice Exercises:**

* **Q Key Focus:**
	* **Single Note Accuracy:** Play a sequence of only Q notes at varying tempos, focusing exclusively on perfect placement and timing. Gradually increase speed.
	* **Q-based Patterns:** Practice short, simple patterns using only the Q key, slowly building complexity.
	* **Hand Position Check:** Ensure correct hand position and posture to facilitate comfortable and accurate Q key presses.
* **Key Consistency:**
	* **Random Key Sequences:** Play random sequences of notes across all keys, focusing on maintaining consistent speed and accuracy.
	* **Alternating Hand Exercises:** Focus on fast, accurate alternating between keys like Q-W-E-R and vice-versa.
* **Timing Improvement:**
	* **Rhythm Training:** Use Guitar Hero's training mode or external rhythm games to improve timing and rhythmic accuracy.  Focus on consistent strumming.

**3. Recommended Training Plan (Next Session):**

1. **Warm-up (10 min):** Easy songs focusing on consistent strumming and rhythmic accuracy.
2. **Q Key Remediation (20 min):**  Focus exclusively on Q key exercises.  Start slow and build speed gradually.
3. **Key Consistency Training (20 min):** Practice random key sequences and alternating hand exercises.
4. **Full Song Practice (20 min):** Play songs at a difficulty level that allows for roughly 80% accuracy.  Focus on maintaining consistency across keys.
5. **Cool-down (10 min):** Easy songs to relax and avoid fatigue.

**4. Encouragement:**

Your R key performance is excellent! This demonstrates your potential for high accuracy with focused practice.  The high number of correct hits overall is also a great sign. With dedicated practice targeting the Q key and improving consistency, you will significantly improve your overall score.  Don't be discouraged by the negative accuracy on the Q key; it is fixable. Focus on proper technique and consistent practice, and you will see substantial improvement.
