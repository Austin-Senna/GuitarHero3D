=== AI Coach Feedback ===
**1. Critical Issues:**

* **No gameplay data:** The player hasn't played any notes, making analysis impossible.  This is the single, overriding issue. We need to start with basic game functionality and controller setup verification.
* **Potential Controller/Game Setup Problem:**  The absence of any data suggests a problem with the game setup, controller calibration, or controller connection.
* **Lack of Fundamental Understanding:**  It's possible the player is completely unfamiliar with the game mechanics.


**2. Practice Exercises:**

* **Controller Check:**  Verify controller is properly plugged in, drivers are installed, and the game recognizes it.  Test controller functionality outside of Guitar Hero.
* **Tutorial Completion:**  Complete the in-game tutorial thoroughly.  Focus on note recognition and timing.
* **Easy Mode Playthrough:**  Begin with the easiest song available, focusing on hitting the notes accurately, even if it means slower speed.


**3. Recommended Training Plan (Next Session):**

1. **(5 min) Controller/Game Setup Test:**  Confirm everything is working correctly.
2. **(10 min) Tutorial Completion:**  Pay close attention to instruction, aiming for 100% accuracy.
3. **(20 min) Easy Song Playthrough:**  Focus on rhythm and accuracy, not speed.  Repeat as needed until consistent 80% accuracy is achieved.
4. **(5 min) Cool-down:**  Reflect on the session, identify personal challenges.


**4. Encouragement:**

It's great you're taking the initiative to learn Guitar Hero!  Don't be discouraged by the initial lack of data – it gives us a clear starting point. We'll get you rocking in no time by focusing on the basics first.  Let's address the technical aspects and then build your skills from there.  We'll start with simple exercises and gradually increase difficulty.  Remember, everyone starts somewhere!
