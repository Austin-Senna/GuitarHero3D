=== AI Coach Feedback ===
**1. Critical Issues:**

* **Significant Accuracy Issues on the 'R' Key:**  A 54.7% accuracy rate on any key is drastically below acceptable. This suggests a major coordination or muscle memory problem with the right pinky finger.
* **Widespread Wrong Key Presses:**  55 wrong key presses across all keys indicate a lack of precision and focus, not just an issue with a specific finger.  This points towards potential issues with note reading speed or hand-eye coordination.
* **Minor Missed Notes:** While few, missed notes suggest occasional lapses in concentration and rhythm maintenance. This is less critical than the other two issues but warrants attention.

**2. Practice Exercises:**

* **R Key Focus:**
    * **Finger Isolation Exercises:**  Isolate the right pinky finger with slow, deliberate practice runs focusing *only* on the 'R' key sections of songs. Gradually increase speed.
    * **R-Key Focused Song Selection:** Choose songs with prominent 'R' key sections but at easier difficulty levels.  Focus on perfect accuracy before increasing difficulty.
* **Precision & Accuracy:**
    * **Slow-Speed Accuracy Runs:** Play songs at significantly slower speeds focusing entirely on perfect accuracy. Gradually increase speed only when accuracy is consistently high.
    * **Rhythm Training Games:** Use rhythm-based training games to improve timing and hand-eye coordination.
* **Missed Note Reduction:**
    * **Full-Song Focus:** Practice entire songs paying close attention to maintaining a consistent rhythm and avoiding anticipation or hesitations.
    * **Mental Focus Drills:** Short meditation or mindfulness exercises before gaming sessions can improve concentration.

**4. Encouragement:**

Your overall score shows significant potential! Your high number of correct hits demonstrates good rhythm and you've already mastered several keys very well.  Focus on honing the precision and accuracy of your 'R' key, and consistent accuracy across all keys, and you'll see a dramatic improvement in your overall score. Remember, consistent practice and focused attention are key. Keep rocking!
